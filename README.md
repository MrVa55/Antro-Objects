This repository contains the python script enabling an art project called “Antropomorhic Objects” to be displayed at Burning Man 2024 (if approved).

The script runs on a Raspberry Pi connected to microphone, speaker, a servo motor and WS2812B programmable LED lights and uses the OpenAI API to allow chatGPT to respond and control lights and motors. 

Requires DancyPi to be installed.

It is currently in a very preliminary state and only works on our prototype - the talking grandfather clock. See video here:
